# Exercises as Compiler Explorer links

On this page are all the example code and exercise starting points, using Compiler Explorer.
Compiler Explorer is astonishingly good for this sort of thing (along with its many other applications), 
    so do please consider supporting Matt and his team of volunteers as they maintain and evolve this precious resource for the community.

## Deus ex Machina

1. We get started with a(n almost) blank slate. This CE link is set up with clang and gcc ready to go with C++20, and a trivial "Hello, World" starting point. There are two versions:
  * [with compilers on the right](https://compiler-explorer.com/z/4nvf18oqh)
  * [with compilers at the bottom](https://compiler-explorer.com/z/eb769TWWa)
2. _Exercise_: "TDD" your way to a minimum viable coroutine.
  * [just clang](https://compiler-explorer.com/z/fMrKhex45).  Instructions in the comments.
